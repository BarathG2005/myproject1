        <p>I have a great circle of friends, both from college and hostel, and each of them adds something unique to my life.</p>
        <p><strong>Guru Prasanth</strong> is one of my closest friends from college. 
            He’s the only one who really matches my vibe in every way. We always connect easily,
             and he’s the one who picks me up when I need support. He’s a true friend, and we share a special bond.</p>
        <p><strong>Bharathram</strong> is another friend of mine who’s always fun to be around.
             He has a very enjoyable personality, and I often find myself doing his work and helping him out. 
             I also share a strong bond with <strong>Ashwin</strong>, and we collaborate on various things in college.</p>
        <p>In hostel, I’m part of a tight-knit group of 18 friends, and we all enjoy each other's company.
             We have a great time during every function and event, especially when we hang out together during <strong>Takshashela</strong>. My hostel friends are very special to me, and we share the same vibe even in the hostel.</p>
        <p>We often engage in fun activities like pillow fights, watching movies together, and creating magic in our hostel life. 
            There are moments when we all come together and even share stories about our families.
             The bond we share in the hostel is something truly memorable.</p>
